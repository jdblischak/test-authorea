Code blocks render nicely on Authorea.
However once they are exported they lose all their formatting.
No grey background, no monospace font, and the quotation marks are misformatted.

Here is a typical code block for testing:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ echo "test" > file.txt
$ wc -l file.txt
      1 file.txt
\end{lstlisting}
