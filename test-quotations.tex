\textbf{Double quotes:}

"word" - online only

\verb|"word"| - online and pdf (non-curly)

\begin{lstlisting}
"word" - online only (non-curly)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Using the LaTeX ticks:}

\href{http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/QuotDash.html}{source}

``word'' - online and pdf (curly)

\verb|``word''| - bad, online renders verbatim, pdf produces strange quote marks

\begin{lstlisting}
``word'' - bad, online renders verbatim, pdf produces normal curly brackets
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Attempt non-curly quotation marks in code blocks:}

Using double quotes simply works when rendered online.
However, offline it creates two curly right-facing quote marks.

\begin{lstlisting}
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
\end{lstlisting}

What about trying to use single quotes?

\begin{lstlisting}
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use 'git add' to track)
\end{lstlisting}

Single quotes are also converted to two right-facing curly single quotes.

\textbf{Conclusions}:

In normal text, use the LaTeX formatting of two single ticks followed by two single quotes.

In verbatim text, use actual double quote marks.

In code blocks created with lstlisting, there is still no way to get non-curly double quotes in pdf output.
